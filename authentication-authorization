**Authentication vs Authorization**

# üîê Authentication vs Authorization in Detail

Both Authentication and Authorization are critical components of application security, but they serve different purposes. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

## üìå Definitions

**Authentication** means verifying who the user is.
**Authorization** means verifying what the user has access to.

---

## üß† Key Differences

* **Purpose**: Authentication confirms user identity. Authorization grants access to resources.
* **Happens When?**: Authentication happens before authorization. Authorization comes after authentication.
* **Data Involved**: Authentication involves username, password, OTP, or biometrics. Authorization involves roles, permissions, and access rules.
* **Example Question**: Authentication asks, "Who are you?" Authorization asks, "Are you allowed to do this?"
* **Example**: Authentication is logging in using email and password. Authorization is getting access to the admin dashboard if the user is an admin.
* **Controlled By**: Authentication is controlled by the login/auth system (e.g., Django Auth). Authorization is controlled by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), policies.
* **Protocols/Technologies**: Authentication uses OAuth2, JWT, SAML, LDAP. Authorization uses ACLs, RBAC, scopes in OAuth2, and Django permissions.
* **Outcome**: The user is verified in Authentication. The user is allowed or denied specific actions in Authorization.

## ‚úÖ Example in Django

**Authentication**:
Using Django's `authenticate` and `login` functions, you verify if a user exists and credentials are valid. If yes, the user is authenticated. If not, the credentials are invalid.

**Authorization**:
Using decorators like `@login_required` and `@permission_required`, you ensure that only logged-in users with specific permissions (like `view_dashboard`) can access certain views or actions.

## üöÄ Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're entering a secure building.
Authentication is when you show your ID to the security guard.
Authorization is when the guard checks if you're allowed to enter specific rooms.

Just because you're authenticated (you are John Doe) doesn‚Äôt mean you're authorized to enter the server room.

## üîê Common Authentication Methods

* **Basic Auth**: Username/password.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Token-based authentication for APIs.
* **OAuth2**: Token-based with scopes, commonly used in Google and GitHub logins.
* **SAML**: Used in enterprise-level Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions.
* **LDAP**: Directory-based authentication (e.g., Active Directory).

---

## üîê Common Authorization Models

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Assign roles like "admin" or "editor" to users.
* **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Grant access based on user, device, or environment attributes.
* **ACL (Access Control Lists)**: Define a list of permissions per object or resource.
* **Scope-based**: Common in OAuth2, restricts actions like `read:users` or `write:orders`.

## üåê Authentication + Authorization in APIs (JWT Example)

A user logs in by sending a POST request to `/login` with their username and password. The server responds with an access token like `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...` which proves the user is authenticated.

To access protected routes like `/admin/dashboard`, the user sends the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...`.

The token proves authentication, and its claims (like `"role": "admin"`) are used to handle authorization.

---

## üîç Summary

Authentication verifies identity. Authorization checks permissions.
Authentication always happens first.
Example: Logging in with username/password is authentication. Getting access only if your role is admin is authorization.
Tools for authentication include Django Auth, JWT, and OAuth. Tools for authorization include Django permissions and RBAC.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

**Authentication**:

* Use strong password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or argon2.
* Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* Use standard and secure protocols like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

**Authorization**:

* Use RBAC or ABAC for scalable permission control.
* Never rely only on frontend code for access control.
* Ensure all routes and resources are protected on the backend.
* Always check token scopes or permissions server-side.
